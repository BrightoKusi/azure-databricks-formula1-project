# Formula 1 Data Analysis with Databricks
This project utilizes Databricks, a cloud-based platform for data processing, to analyze Formula 1 racing data.

## Project Goals
- Extract and ingest data on races, drivers, constructors, and other relevant information.
- Clean and transform the raw data for further analysis.
- Perform analyses to answer interesting questions about Formula 1, such as:
Driver performance across seasons and circuits
Effectiveness of pit stop strategies
Trends in race outcomes
Identifying dominant teams and drivers
- Build a data pipeline to automate the process of data ingestion, transformation, and storage for ongoing analysis.

## Project Structure
The project will be organized with the following directories:

- data/: Stores raw and processed Formula 1 data.
- raw/: Contains the original data downloaded from various sources.
- processed/: Holds the cleaned and transformed data ready for analysis.
- notebooks/: Houses Databricks notebooks for data processing and analysis.
- ingestion/: Notebooks for extracting and loading data into Databricks.
- transformation/: Notebooks for cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data.
- analysis/: Notebooks for performing various analyses on the Formula 1 data.
- documentation/: (Optional) Includes additional documents like this README file and any other relevant explanations.
- scripts/: (Optional) Contains scripts for automating tasks or deploying the project.

## Technologies Used
- Databricks: Cloud-based platform for data processing and analytics.
- Apache Spark: Open-source framework for large-scale data processing used within Databricks notebooks.
- (Optional) Additional libraries for data manipulation or visualization depending on your specific analysis needs.

## Getting Started
1. Set up Databricks: Create a Databricks workspace and configure access to project folders.
2. Data Acquisition: Determine your data sources (e.g., APIs, CSV files) and implement data ingestion notebooks.
3. Data Transformation: Write notebooks to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into a usable format.
4. Data Analysis: Utilize notebooks for exploratory data analysis and answer your specific Formula 1 questions.
5. Data Pipeline: Build notebooks or scripts to automate the data ingestion and transformation process for ongoing analysis.
